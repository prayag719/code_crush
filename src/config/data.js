      "What is Competitive Programming?  It's basically a mind-sport where you are given a problem and you have come up with optimized solutions for given constraints with your coding skills. This helps in building our logical thinking and analytical thinking skills and most importantly your data structure and algorithms knowledge.  Learn a language  1: The most preferred language used in competitive programming is C++, Java. I prefer C++ always because it is flexible, very fast. C++ has many Data structures and Algorithms built-in library which makes it easier while coding.  2: Java This language is also used widely in programming but one drawback is it is not suitable for beginner programmers because it is longer code to write and not beginner-friendly.  Practice basic problems from these sites.  Hackerrank  I think this will be one of the best beginner-friendly websites for practicing basic problems. here there a wide range of problems from beginner to advanced. Even we can practice in different languages C, C++, Java, Python, etc...  HackerEarth  HackerEarth is an Indian company focusing on coding problems and hiring challenges. Even this platform provides good beginner-friendly questions. Here there will monthly contest held where you can participate. this website has tutorials for all practice topics. It hosts competitions conducted by various MNC's and Colleges  I think these two websites are more enough for practicing basic questions.  Learn Data structure and Algorithms  Once you are done with the basics of coding and practicing it then it's time to learn Data Structure And Algorithms.  This is the most important thing that should be learned and practiced. Having good knowledge of Ds&Algo will make up a more optimal solution for the problem we are trying to solve.  Important Data Structures and Algorithm Topics:  * Array  * Stack  * Queue  * Linked list  * Tree's  * Graph's  * Hash table's   * Trie's  * Dynamic Programming   * Divide and Conquer   * Backtracking  Pratice..Practice...Pratice....  Next is completely based on your practice to be master in competitive programming.The more you practice the more you get stronger.  There are different websites you can practice competitive programming  1:Codechef  2:Codeforces  3:Topcoder  4:Sphere Online Judge  Resources.  1: Introduction To Algorithms  2: MIT OpenCourseWare  3: Cp-Algorithms  Even you can go through GeeksforGeeks for additional reference.  Everything cannot be done overnight. You have to be focused on your learning and practicing problems. Just put up your goals, time table and follow through with it.

    title: "How to Build Successful Projects as a Junior Developer",
    category: "Software Development",
    subCategory:  ['Developer', 'Project'],
    description:
      "Several months ago, I stumbled upon a coding challenge that intrigued me. Here's what it was:   Fun frontend question I was asked in an interview one time   Build six squares with no color   Every time you click one, it turns green   When the last square turns green, they all go back to no color in backwards sequence to which it was clicked (not all at once)   The task was seemingly simple: build six squares with no color, make each square turn green when clicked. Then when the last square turned green, make them all go back to no color in the reverse order in which they were clicked.   I was excited to test out the skills of some junior developers I was working with who were just starting out in tech, so I shared the challenge with them. But the results were not what I expected.   Despite its apparent simplicity, the challenge brought out varying results. Some students successfully created a functional solution, while others struggled with the required programming concepts.   That's when I realized that this could be a great opportunity for a lot of people. So if you're a junior developer finding it challenging to create your own portfolio/demo projects, fear not! This article will guide you through the process of successfully building a project with a straightforward approach.   Who is This Article For?   This article is specifically tailored for junior developers who might be struggling to create their own personal side projects.   If you often find yourself relying on tutorials or feel like you lack the creativity to create projects independently, then this article is for you.   Getting Started   Let's take a look at the challenge I sent the students:   Build six squares with no color    Every time you click one, it turns green    When the last square turns green, they all go back to no color in backwards sequence to which it was clicked (not all at once)   If you were one of the students presented with this challenge, what would you do first? While it may be tempting to dive right into coding, it's important to recognize that writing code is actually the last step of building a project.   So, what's the first step? The first step is to think. Yeah I mean to literally stop and think about the problem you're trying to solve.   How to Think About the Problem   When approaching a project, it's important to think of it as a problem that needs a solution. Take your time to carefully consider the problem, and then break it down into smaller parts.   To do this, you may find it helpful to step away from your computer and grab a pencil and piece of paper.   For example, when faced with any kind of challenge, you can start by breaking the project down into more manageable parts. This might include:   Creating the six squares   Determining a way to change their color when clicked   Create a mechanism to track which squares have been clicked   Devise a method for the squares to return to their original state in the reverse order they were clicked   No matter how big a project may seem, it's always important to break it down into smaller parts. This makes it easier to tackle each individual piece one at a time while staying organized and focused.   So, when faced with a large project, don't be intimidated. Instead, take the time to break it down into smaller pieces and focus on tackling each piece individually. By doing so, you'll be able to stay organized, stay focused, and ultimately be more successful in your project.   After taking some time to carefully consider the challenge, I was able to come up with a potential solution. Here's what I came up with:   After you have carefully thought about your project, you can now move on to the next step, which is actually building your project.   How to Solve the Problem and Build the Solution   After careful consideration of the challenge, it's time to move on to building the project. Let's go through the steps:   Step 1: Create the Six Squares   In this step, we have three things to do: create six individual buttons in HTML, give each button the class name of a square, and give them unique IDs.   Step 2: Determine a way to change their color when clicked.   In this step, we just have two tasks: ADD a CLICK Event Listener to each button, and then call a function called UpdateSquares() that changes the color of a clicked button.   Step 3: Create a mechanism to track which squares have been clicked.   In the next step we need to create an empty array called array_sqr that stores the unique ID of a clicked button. Then, when a button has been clicked, we need to add the ID to the array.   Step 4: Devise a method for the squares to return to their original state in the reverse order they were clicked.   In this last step, we have to call a function ReverseSquares() when array_sqr.length == 6.     In the ReverseSquares() function, loop through array_sqr. Inside the loop, select each button with the unique IDs in array_sqr and remove the color green from the selected button.   With the code above, we are practically done with the project, and it works as expected-ish.    How to Improve the Solution   Our project currently has a problem where the color is removed from all the squares at the same time. So we need to fix that.   Every project has to undergo this crucial step of making updates and fixes. It's very hard to build a perfect project on your first try. I didn't even build the demo in this tutorial on my first try.   Improving your project can sometimes be even tougher than building the project itself. Fun fact: it took me more time to get the colors to change at different intervals than actually writing the code for the demo I used in this tutorial.   This steps generally involves a lot of Googling and sometimes even asking others for help. It’s perfectly okay to do that – it doesn't make you a bad developer.   Summary   Creating side projects as a junior developer might seem challenging. But by following a systematic approach of thinking things through, planning out your code, actually coding, and then improving on your solution, you can successfully build projects that showcase your skills and creativity.   Don't be afraid to break down larger projects into smaller, more manageable parts. And remember that improvement is an integral part of the development process.",

    title: "CSS Grid Handbook – Complete Guide to Grid Containers and Grid Items",
    category: "Web Development",
    subCategory: ['CSS', 'Roadmap'],
    description:
      "What is CSS Grid?   The CSS Grid Layout Module makes browsers display the selected HTML elements as grid box models.   Grid allows you to easily resize and reposition a grid container and its items two-dimensionally.   Note:   Two-dimensionally means grid modules allow simultaneous laying out of box models in rows and columns.   Use Flexbox if you only need to resize and reposition elements one-dimensionally.   Grid Container vs. Grid Item: What's the Difference?   A grid container is an HTML element whose display propertys value is grid or inline-grid.   A grid item is any of the direct children of a grid container.   What Is a grid Value in CSS?   grid tells browsers to display the selected HTML element as a block-level grid box model.   In other words, setting an elements display propertys value to grid turns the box model into a block-level grid layout module.   The snippet above used the grid value to convert the HTML documents <section> elements from regular <section> nodes to block-level grid box models.   Note:   The display: grid directive creates only a single-column grid container. Therefore, the grid items will display in the normal layout flow (one item below another).   Converting a node to a grid box model makes the elements direct children become grid items.   The display: grid directive only affects a box model and its direct children. It does not affect grandchildren nodes.   Lets now discuss the inline-grid value.   What Is an inline-grid Value in CSS?   inline-grid tells browsers to display the selected HTML element as an inline-level grid box model.   In other words, setting an elements display propertys value to inline-grid turns the box model into an inline-level grid layout module.   Properties for Specifying a Grids Layout   On converting a regular HTML element to a grid (or inline-grid) box model, the grid layout module provides two categories of properties for positioning the grid box and its direct children:   Grid containers properties   Grid items properties   What Are the Grid Containers Properties?   A grid containers properties specify how browsers should layout items within the grid box model.   Note: We define a grid containers property on the container, not its items.   The eight (8) types of grid container properties are:   grid-template-columns   grid-template-rows   grid-auto-columns   grid-auto-rows   justify-content   justify-items   align-content   align-items   Lets discuss the eight types now.   What Is CSS Grids grid-template-columns Property?   grid-template-columns specifies the number and widths of columns browsers should display in the selected grid container.   What Is CSS Grids justify-content Property?   justify-content specifies how browsers should position a grid containers columns along its row axis.   Note:   A row axis is sometimes called an inline axis.   The justify-content property works if the total column widths are less than the grid containers width. In other words, you need free space along the containers row axis to justify its columns left or right.   The justify-content property accepts the following values:   start   center   end   stretch   space-between   space-around   space-evenly   What is justify-content: space-between in CSS Grid?   space-between does the following:   It positions a grid containers first column with its row-start edge.   It positions the containers last column with the row-end edge.   It creates even spacing between each pair of columns between the first and last columns.   What Is CSS Grids align-content Property?   align-content specifies how browsers should align a grid containers rows along the containers column axis.   Note:   A column axis is sometimes called a block axis.   The align-content property works if the total row heights are less than the grid containers height. In other words, you need free space along the containers column axis to align its rows up or down.   The align-content property accepts the following values:   start   center   end   stretch   space-between   space-around   space-evenly",

    title: "What is a Compiler? How Does It Work? (An Easy Explanation)",
    category: "ComputerScience",
    subCategory: ['Compiler', 'Memory Management'],
    description:
      "Introduction:  A computer’s CPU, which is responsible for running your code, doesn’t understand JavaScript, Go, C++ or any other high-level programming languages that we know. These high-level languages, are basically some layers of abstraction, made by computer programmers and engineers, so speaking to a computer becomes easier for us as humans.   What is a Compiler?   A CPU, and computer’s hardware in general, only understand zeros and ones, which we technically refer to as binary code. The reason behind this is that a computer’s hardware is basically made out of billions of transistors, which can only have two states: on or off. These “on” and “off” states are represented with zeros and ones; 1 meaning on, thus the electrons pass through, and 0 meaning off, which stops electricity from passing through a transistor. Literally everything that a computer does, is made possible by these on or off states of those tiny transistors.   Now, compilers are fascinating tools that transform the high-level code written by programmers, which is more easily readable by humans compared to zeros and ones, into binary code language that computers understand.   At its core, a compiler is like a translator. Just as a person might translate Spanish into English, a compiler translates the code written in a high-level programming language, into machine code (binary code).   But How Do Compilers Work?   The process of compilation, which is the name of what a compiler does under the hood, involves several stages. Here we take a brief look at each of these stages, all with real examples:   1. Lexical Analysis: This is the first step where the compiler breaks down the code into basic elements or tokens. For example, in the line String greeting = 'Hello';, the tokens would be String, greeting, =, 'Hello', and ;​.   2. Syntax Analysis: Here, the compiler uses the tokens to build a structure called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which represents the logical structure of the program. This step checks the grammatical structure of the code and looks for syntax errors​. If an AST’s structure becomes invalid, the compiler immediately knows that the original code had a syntax error, and in most cases it knows exactly where the error is coming from.   3. Semantic Analysis: The compiler uses the AST to detect semantic errors, such as assigning the wrong type to a variable or using a keyword as a variable name. This stage includes type checking, flow control checking, and label checking​.   4. Intermediate Code Generation: The compiler generates an intermediate code that is machine-independent; meaning that it can be used on any hardware later on to generate the final binary code for that specific machine. This also means that the code can be easily translated into the machine code of any target machine. The intermediate code can be either high-level, similar to the source language, or low-level, closer to machine code​. Now you might ask, if the generated intermediate language may be sometimes similar to the source code or another high-level language, what is the need for generating it at all? Can’t we just make the original source code machine-independent? The answer is pretty easy: The compiler does that so it can optimize the code way more easily, make sure that the code has the least amount of dependencies to your current hardware, and the complexity of designing a compiler decreases.   5. Optimization: In this phase, the compiler makes the code more efficient without altering its meaning and purpose. The optimization focuses on consuming fewer resources and speeding up the operation of the software​. This is where the intermediate language that was generated in the previous step becomes really handy! In the upcoming example, the original source code written in C was this:   Then it was used to generate the intermediate code, which consists of a highly inefficient loop, and then was optimized by the compiler to eliminate the problematic part:   6. Code Generation: Finally, the compiler converts the optimized intermediate code into the machine code specific to the target machine. This code should be efficient in terms of memory and CPU resource usage​. This is actually where the compiler does its magic! It knows if your CPU understands Spanish Binary (which is a word that I just made up to make it easier to understand) or English Binary. Our Mr. Translator knows exactly what each of those words of the intermediate language mean in the binary language of your own CPU. How? By examining and using the actual hardware that you’re using, and sometimes some of the high-level APIs that are accessible from the operating system itself.   If you’re really into designing a compiler, I suggest you start with reading the code of open-source compilers. This gives you a clear vision of what is exactly going on under the hood. Also by contributing to these open-source compilers, you’re not only helping yourself learn more by getting your hands dirty, but also helping a lot of people out there who are actually using those tools! That’s how we, as software engineers, have each other’s backs. :)",

      "Text Generation, Image Generation, Image Processing, Generating Summaries Of Entire Novels, etc. there are only a handful of things that AI can’t do yet. AI is now basically everywhere. Need an essay for school homework? Piece of cake. Need help debugging your code? No problem. Need help solving a complicated math problem? AI can assist you with that as well. These things seemed very difficult a few decades ago, now, everyone can obtain these things, even on a smartphone. So what exactly is the reason for this sudden outburst of AI in almost every department   Let us first understand how AI generation works. The proper name of this AI is Generative AI, also called Gen AI. Generative AI is a type of AI that generates new content based on existing content. Generative AI can generate texts, images, videos, audio, and so much more. Generative AI models are trained by feeding them loads of data, and by loads I mean, billions of different types of data. AI models can be trained or fine-tuned to perform some particular types of tasks.   Please note that this is a very high-level explanation of how Gen AI models work. Training and working on AI models is a very deep and complex task, which requires lots of time and resources. And this is mainly the reason why AI is so advanced now.   You see, training AI models requires a lot of processing power. With the increased computing power that we have these days, AI models that can perform various tasks can be trained. More computing power allows more complex and more sophisticated AI models to be made. Also, faster computers help AI models run more efficiently.   A big factor is the availability of a large dataset. The more data you provide to an AI model, the more it learns and the more creative its output is. A larger dataset enables AI models to know more and thus generate better results, learn from more patterns, and make better predictions. Thus, providing a larger dataset to AI models has helped them in becoming more advanced.   Another big reason is the development of better algorithms. Programmers and engineers all over the world have worked a lot in the past few years to develop new algorithms, and better algorithms, to train more advanced and sophisticated AI models. These algorithms are made particularly for various types of AI models. Since these algorithms are more efficient, they help these models to generate better and more accurate results that look very real and authentic.   So, all of these factors have now made AI much more advanced than it was ten years ago. With various tools such as Chat GPT, Google Bard, Bing AI, LaMDA, and more, writing things like blogs and essays has become much easier. AI has become so advanced these days that it has become hard to identify what is real and what is AI-generated, in fact, this very blog that you are reading about AI could be AI-generated! Is it or is it not? ;)",

    title: 'Bitrise Tightens Mobile DevOps Integration With AWS Cloud Services',
    category: 'DevOps',
    subCategory: ['Docker', 'Deploy', 'AWS'],
    description:
      "Bitrise this week will tighten integration with its DevOps platform for building and deploying mobile applications and the application development services provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud  Announced at the AWS re:Invent 2023 conference, the goal is to provide easier access to automated building, testing and release management capabilities provided by AWS as part of an effort to increase overall efficiency.  Bitrise CEO Barnabas Birmacher said those capabilities will streamline workflows for a Bitrise Mobile DevOps platform that has been specifically designed for building and deploying mobile applications that typically need to be updated frequently.  Based on a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform developed by Bitrise that can be deployed in an AWS cloud computing environment, the integrations will make it simpler to build and run mobile applications at scale, noted Birmacher.  The goal is to reduce the total cost of building mobile applications while at the same time improving developer productivity for mobile applications that have to be thoroughly tested before being made accessible via an application store, he added.  It’s not clear how many organizations will prefer to have a dedicated CI/CD platform for building and deploying mobile applications versus using the same CI/CD platform they might already be relying on to build and deploy other applications. Bitrise claims to have more than 6,000 customers, including Reddit, WISE, Equinox and Philips Hue.  As the percentage of mobile applications that make up an organization’s portfolio continues to increase, the pace at which those applications need to be updated lends itself better to a CI/CD platform optimized for those types of applications, said Birmacher.  In fact, a recent survey conducted by Bitrise found 62% of respondents have been adversely impacted by manual processes that slowed the rate at which mobile applications were deployed and updated. The survey also found (44%) of respondents reported their release approval process is mostly or entirely manual, with only 9% having fully automated application releases.  The survey also found that nearly two-thirds of organizations (66%) have deployed applications that can’t be opened in two seconds or less, which is widely considered the accepted level of performance required for mobile applications. In addition, three-quarters of organizations (75%) required more than two days to address bug fixes.  Many mobile apps have become increasingly mission-critical thanks to digital business transformation initiatives. Consequently, the amount of focus on them within most organizations is high; any issues that arise are likely to be noticed at the highest echelons of an organization. That level of attention can easily put pressure on DevOps teams, mainly because the general expectation among end users is that mobile applications will be regularly updated with new functionality. However, if release processes are largely manual, regularly improving the user experience can become problematic.  Each IT organization will need to decide for itself how best to go about building and deploying mobile applications, but the one thing that is certain is adjustments to DevOps workflows will need to be made as a lot more of these applications are continuously built, deployed and updated.

//     description: "As programmers we are all came accross on solving many problems but we usually struck at writing optimum code in order to use less resources like time and space, In searching how to write a optimum code we end up listening DSA  what is dsa?  dsa full form is datastructures and algorithms .  in the name itself we see that two titles but these are connected to each other  Datastructures:  Datastructures are used to store and organise the data in an efficient manner so that we can access them efficiently or effectively , by using datastructures we can reduce the resource usage by our code which makes code more readable.  Algorithms : Algorithm is a set of instructions executed in a step-by-step manner in oreder to complete a task, Algorithm can be expressed in natural language, flowchart,or by psudocode,  there are different types of algorithms to solve different tasks,algorithm contains finite number of instructions  Why to Learn DSA?  before moving to the main topic that is How to Kick start DSA we need to discuss Why to learn DSA.  Many techies used to think that there is no need of learning datastructures and algorithms if you are one of them then you need to understand that learning dsa will enable us to write optimum code,it also improves our problem skills, and mostly nowadays companies are looking for programmers who has proficient knowledge on dsa.  apart from tech-industries datastructures and algorithms are also used in our daily life from making a TEA to DRIVING A CAR  for example if we want to make a tea what are the steps included in it  switch on the stove  keep bowl on the stove  add milk and sugar and teapowder  wait for few minutes  tea is ready  from the above example we followed few steps in order these step-by-step set of instructions are called algorithm  and bowl,stove,sugar,teapowder are datasturctures  How to Kick start DSA  Now we move to the main topic that is How to Kick start DSA  In this article i have tried to explain How to Kick start DSA as simple as i can so that you can understand clearly.  1.Select a Programming language  First and formost thing you need to have a basic knowledge on any one programming language ,as we know DSA is a theory but inorder to understand it practically and remember long time then we need to execute it , it is only possible if you have a decent knowledge on any one programming language ,  It is not that you need to be perfect in that language but you need to understand basics like  datatypes  conditional statements  loops  functions  oops...  2.Learn time and space complixities  Time complixity: the amount of time taken by the algorithm as a function of length of input  space complixity: The amount of memory space used by the algorithm/program or total memory space used by variable in program  3.Learn basic Datastructures and Algorithma  Learn the basic Algorithms like  searching  binary search  sorting  quick sort  bubble sort  merg sort  Learn basic Datastructures like  Arrays  Strings  Linkedlists  4.Practice practice practice  Dont just keep learning things it dosent make any sence because at some point you will forget the topic that you have learned before  so the best way to master the DSA is to practice.  there is proverb called practice makes man perfect  this proverb exactly suits to DSA  There are many sites to practice DSA which gives you push start  like.  Leetcode  Codechef  Geeks-for-Geeks  Codeforces  Hackerrank  etc.....  you can visit this sites and register yourself and start practicing.  5.Learn Advanced Dsa  After practicing problems on basic DSA you need to move on learning advance datastructures and algorithms, it may takes a long time to understanding but trust me once you get its roots you will play with the question  Hardwork+practice+consistancy=DSA",

//       "What is Competitive Programming?  It's basically a mind-sport where you are given a problem and you have come up with optimized solutions for given constraints with your coding skills. This helps in building our logical thinking and analytical thinking skills and most importantly your data structure and algorithms knowledge.  Learn a language  1: The most preferred language used in competitive programming is C++, Java. I prefer C++ always because it is flexible, very fast. C++ has many Data structures and Algorithms built-in library which makes it easier while coding.  2: Java This language is also used widely in programming but one drawback is it is not suitable for beginner programmers because it is longer code to write and not beginner-friendly.  Practice basic problems from these sites.  Hackerrank  I think this will be one of the best beginner-friendly websites for practicing basic problems. here there a wide range of problems from beginner to advanced. Even we can practice in different languages C, C++, Java, Python, etc...  HackerEarth  HackerEarth is an Indian company focusing on coding problems and hiring challenges. Even this platform provides good beginner-friendly questions. Here there will monthly contest held where you can participate. this website has tutorials for all practice topics. It hosts competitions conducted by various MNC's and Colleges  I think these two websites are more enough for practicing basic questions.  Learn Data structure and Algorithms  Once you are done with the basics of coding and practicing it then it's time to learn Data Structure And Algorithms.  This is the most important thing that should be learned and practiced. Having good knowledge of Ds&Algo will make up a more optimal solution for the problem we are trying to solve.  Important Data Structures and Algorithm Topics:  * Array  * Stack  * Queue  * Linked list  * Tree's  * Graph's  * Hash table's   * Trie's  * Dynamic Programming   * Divide and Conquer   * Backtracking  Pratice..Practice...Pratice....  Next is completely based on your practice to be master in competitive programming.The more you practice the more you get stronger.  There are different websites you can practice competitive programming  1:Codechef  2:Codeforces  3:Topcoder  4:Sphere Online Judge  Resources.  1: Introduction To Algorithms  2: MIT OpenCourseWare  3: Cp-Algorithms  Even you can go through GeeksforGeeks for additional reference.  Everything cannot be done overnight. You have to be focused on your learning and practicing problems. Just put up your goals, time table and follow through with it.

//     description:
//       "Several months ago, I stumbled upon a coding challenge that intrigued me. Here's what it was:   Fun frontend question I was asked in an interview one time   Build six squares with no color   Every time you click one, it turns green   When the last square turns green, they all go back to no color in backwards sequence to which it was clicked (not all at once)   The task was seemingly simple: build six squares with no color, make each square turn green when clicked. Then when the last square turned green, make them all go back to no color in the reverse order in which they were clicked.   I was excited to test out the skills of some junior developers I was working with who were just starting out in tech, so I shared the challenge with them. But the results were not what I expected.   Despite its apparent simplicity, the challenge brought out varying results. Some students successfully created a functional solution, while others struggled with the required programming concepts.   That's when I realized that this could be a great opportunity for a lot of people. So if you're a junior developer finding it challenging to create your own portfolio/demo projects, fear not! This article will guide you through the process of successfully building a project with a straightforward approach.   Who is This Article For?   This article is specifically tailored for junior developers who might be struggling to create their own personal side projects.   If you often find yourself relying on tutorials or feel like you lack the creativity to create projects independently, then this article is for you.   Getting Started   Let's take a look at the challenge I sent the students:   Build six squares with no color    Every time you click one, it turns green    When the last square turns green, they all go back to no color in backwards sequence to which it was clicked (not all at once)   If you were one of the students presented with this challenge, what would you do first? While it may be tempting to dive right into coding, it's important to recognize that writing code is actually the last step of building a project.   So, what's the first step? The first step is to think. Yeah I mean to literally stop and think about the problem you're trying to solve.   How to Think About the Problem   When approaching a project, it's important to think of it as a problem that needs a solution. Take your time to carefully consider the problem, and then break it down into smaller parts.   To do this, you may find it helpful to step away from your computer and grab a pencil and piece of paper.   For example, when faced with any kind of challenge, you can start by breaking the project down into more manageable parts. This might include:   Creating the six squares   Determining a way to change their color when clicked   Create a mechanism to track which squares have been clicked   Devise a method for the squares to return to their original state in the reverse order they were clicked   No matter how big a project may seem, it's always important to break it down into smaller parts. This makes it easier to tackle each individual piece one at a time while staying organized and focused.   So, when faced with a large project, don't be intimidated. Instead, take the time to break it down into smaller pieces and focus on tackling each piece individually. By doing so, you'll be able to stay organized, stay focused, and ultimately be more successful in your project.   After taking some time to carefully consider the challenge, I was able to come up with a potential solution. Here's what I came up with:   After you have carefully thought about your project, you can now move on to the next step, which is actually building your project.   How to Solve the Problem and Build the Solution   After careful consideration of the challenge, it's time to move on to building the project. Let's go through the steps:   Step 1: Create the Six Squares   In this step, we have three things to do: create six individual buttons in HTML, give each button the class name of a square, and give them unique IDs.   Step 2: Determine a way to change their color when clicked.   In this step, we just have two tasks: ADD a CLICK Event Listener to each button, and then call a function called UpdateSquares() that changes the color of a clicked button.   Step 3: Create a mechanism to track which squares have been clicked.   In the next step we need to create an empty array called array_sqr that stores the unique ID of a clicked button. Then, when a button has been clicked, we need to add the ID to the array.   Step 4: Devise a method for the squares to return to their original state in the reverse order they were clicked.   In this last step, we have to call a function ReverseSquares() when array_sqr.length == 6.     In the ReverseSquares() function, loop through array_sqr. Inside the loop, select each button with the unique IDs in array_sqr and remove the color green from the selected button.   With the code above, we are practically done with the project, and it works as expected-ish.    How to Improve the Solution   Our project currently has a problem where the color is removed from all the squares at the same time. So we need to fix that.   Every project has to undergo this crucial step of making updates and fixes. It's very hard to build a perfect project on your first try. I didn't even build the demo in this tutorial on my first try.   Improving your project can sometimes be even tougher than building the project itself. Fun fact: it took me more time to get the colors to change at different intervals than actually writing the code for the demo I used in this tutorial.   This steps generally involves a lot of Googling and sometimes even asking others for help. It’s perfectly okay to do that – it doesn't make you a bad developer.   Summary   Creating side projects as a junior developer might seem challenging. But by following a systematic approach of thinking things through, planning out your code, actually coding, and then improving on your solution, you can successfully build projects that showcase your skills and creativity.   Don't be afraid to break down larger projects into smaller, more manageable parts. And remember that improvement is an integral part of the development process.",

//     title: 'CSS Grid Handbook – Complete Guide to Grid Containers and Grid Items',
//     category: 'Web Development',
//     subCategory: ['CSS', 'Roadmap'],
//     description:
//       "What is CSS Grid?   The CSS Grid Layout Module makes browsers display the selected HTML elements as grid box models.   Grid allows you to easily resize and reposition a grid container and its items two-dimensionally.   Note:   Two-dimensionally means grid modules allow simultaneous laying out of box models in rows and columns.   Use Flexbox if you only need to resize and reposition elements one-dimensionally.   Grid Container vs. Grid Item: What's the Difference?   A grid container is an HTML element whose display propertys value is grid or inline-grid.   A grid item is any of the direct children of a grid container.   What Is a grid Value in CSS?   grid tells browsers to display the selected HTML element as a block-level grid box model.   In other words, setting an elements display propertys value to grid turns the box model into a block-level grid layout module.   The snippet above used the grid value to convert the HTML documents <section> elements from regular <section> nodes to block-level grid box models.   Note:   The display: grid directive creates only a single-column grid container. Therefore, the grid items will display in the normal layout flow (one item below another).   Converting a node to a grid box model makes the elements direct children become grid items.   The display: grid directive only affects a box model and its direct children. It does not affect grandchildren nodes.   Lets now discuss the inline-grid value.   What Is an inline-grid Value in CSS?   inline-grid tells browsers to display the selected HTML element as an inline-level grid box model.   In other words, setting an elements display propertys value to inline-grid turns the box model into an inline-level grid layout module.   Properties for Specifying a Grids Layout   On converting a regular HTML element to a grid (or inline-grid) box model, the grid layout module provides two categories of properties for positioning the grid box and its direct children:   Grid containers properties   Grid items properties   What Are the Grid Containers Properties?   A grid containers properties specify how browsers should layout items within the grid box model.   Note: We define a grid containers property on the container, not its items.   The eight (8) types of grid container properties are:   grid-template-columns   grid-template-rows   grid-auto-columns   grid-auto-rows   justify-content   justify-items   align-content   align-items   Lets discuss the eight types now.   What Is CSS Grids grid-template-columns Property?   grid-template-columns specifies the number and widths of columns browsers should display in the selected grid container.   What Is CSS Grids justify-content Property?   justify-content specifies how browsers should position a grid containers columns along its row axis.   Note:   A row axis is sometimes called an inline axis.   The justify-content property works if the total column widths are less than the grid containers width. In other words, you need free space along the containers row axis to justify its columns left or right.   The justify-content property accepts the following values:   start   center   end   stretch   space-between   space-around   space-evenly   What is justify-content: space-between in CSS Grid?   space-between does the following:   It positions a grid containers first column with its row-start edge.   It positions the containers last column with the row-end edge.   It creates even spacing between each pair of columns between the first and last columns.   What Is CSS Grids align-content Property?   align-content specifies how browsers should align a grid containers rows along the containers column axis.   Note:   A column axis is sometimes called a block axis.   The align-content property works if the total row heights are less than the grid containers height. In other words, you need free space along the containers column axis to align its rows up or down.   The align-content property accepts the following values:   start   center   end   stretch   space-between   space-around   space-evenly",

//     category: 'ComputerScience',
//     subCategory: ['Compiler', 'Memory Management'],
//     description:
//       "Introduction:  A computer’s CPU, which is responsible for running your code, doesn’t understand JavaScript, Go, C++ or any other high-level programming languages that we know. These high-level languages, are basically some layers of abstraction, made by computer programmers and engineers, so speaking to a computer becomes easier for us as humans.   What is a Compiler?   A CPU, and computer’s hardware in general, only understand zeros and ones, which we technically refer to as binary code. The reason behind this is that a computer’s hardware is basically made out of billions of transistors, which can only have two states: on or off. These “on” and “off” states are represented with zeros and ones; 1 meaning on, thus the electrons pass through, and 0 meaning off, which stops electricity from passing through a transistor. Literally everything that a computer does, is made possible by these on or off states of those tiny transistors.   Now, compilers are fascinating tools that transform the high-level code written by programmers, which is more easily readable by humans compared to zeros and ones, into binary code language that computers understand.   At its core, a compiler is like a translator. Just as a person might translate Spanish into English, a compiler translates the code written in a high-level programming language, into machine code (binary code).   But How Do Compilers Work?   The process of compilation, which is the name of what a compiler does under the hood, involves several stages. Here we take a brief look at each of these stages, all with real examples:   1. Lexical Analysis: This is the first step where the compiler breaks down the code into basic elements or tokens. For example, in the line String greeting = 'Hello';, the tokens would be String, greeting, =, 'Hello', and ;​.   2. Syntax Analysis: Here, the compiler uses the tokens to build a structure called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which represents the logical structure of the program. This step checks the grammatical structure of the code and looks for syntax errors​. If an AST’s structure becomes invalid, the compiler immediately knows that the original code had a syntax error, and in most cases it knows exactly where the error is coming from.   3. Semantic Analysis: The compiler uses the AST to detect semantic errors, such as assigning the wrong type to a variable or using a keyword as a variable name. This stage includes type checking, flow control checking, and label checking​.   4. Intermediate Code Generation: The compiler generates an intermediate code that is machine-independent; meaning that it can be used on any hardware later on to generate the final binary code for that specific machine. This also means that the code can be easily translated into the machine code of any target machine. The intermediate code can be either high-level, similar to the source language, or low-level, closer to machine code​. Now you might ask, if the generated intermediate language may be sometimes similar to the source code or another high-level language, what is the need for generating it at all? Can’t we just make the original source code machine-independent? The answer is pretty easy: The compiler does that so it can optimize the code way more easily, make sure that the code has the least amount of dependencies to your current hardware, and the complexity of designing a compiler decreases.   5. Optimization: In this phase, the compiler makes the code more efficient without altering its meaning and purpose. The optimization focuses on consuming fewer resources and speeding up the operation of the software​. This is where the intermediate language that was generated in the previous step becomes really handy! In the upcoming example, the original source code written in C was this:   Then it was used to generate the intermediate code, which consists of a highly inefficient loop, and then was optimized by the compiler to eliminate the problematic part:   6. Code Generation: Finally, the compiler converts the optimized intermediate code into the machine code specific to the target machine. This code should be efficient in terms of memory and CPU resource usage​. This is actually where the compiler does its magic! It knows if your CPU understands Spanish Binary (which is a word that I just made up to make it easier to understand) or English Binary. Our Mr. Translator knows exactly what each of those words of the intermediate language mean in the binary language of your own CPU. How? By examining and using the actual hardware that you’re using, and sometimes some of the high-level APIs that are accessible from the operating system itself.   If you’re really into designing a compiler, I suggest you start with reading the code of open-source compilers. This gives you a clear vision of what is exactly going on under the hood. Also by contributing to these open-source compilers, you’re not only helping yourself learn more by getting your hands dirty, but also helping a lot of people out there who are actually using those tools! That’s how we, as software engineers, have each other’s backs. :)",

Renowned as one of the premier note-taking tools, it transforms my reading experience with its adept functionalities. From dissecting books and research papers to meticulous note-taking, highlighting, and seamless edits, Goodnotes is my digital canvas. The ability to synchronize notes across all devices adds a layer of convenience that I now find indispensable. Reflecting on my academic journey, I can’t help but wish I had embraced it sooner, opting for its digital prowess over traditional hard copies during my university years.    4. Visual Studio Code    Every developer needs an IDE. It can vary based on your personal preference. In my case, it is VS Code. Just pick one and stick with it unless there is a reason not to.    5. Notebooks    Enter the world of Jupyter Notebooks — swift and dynamic arenas for prototyping and testing Python code. The beauty lies in the ability to craft code within cells, enabling on-the-fly execution. No more running the entire program repeatedly; Jupyter Notebooks offer an iterative and efficient approach. It’s a common strategy among developers: a swift deployment in notebooks for rapid testing, followed by the transformation into structured Python project files for the polished final product. Harness the power of Jupyter Notebooks for seamless code development and swift iteration. A must-know tool for data science and machine learning engineers. It is very easy.    6. Miro / Lucidcharts    Online visual collaboration tools like Miro and Lucidchart have become indispensable assets for teams and individuals seeking dynamic ways to communicate and brainstorm in the digital era. They excel in crafting intricate diagrams, from flowcharts to organizational charts, and provide a user-friendly interface that promotes real-time collaboration. It is a versatile online whiteboarding experience, extending beyond diagrams to support a plethora of creative collaboration activities, from brainstorming to agile project planning. Both tools share a commitment to seamless integration with popular platforms, making them effortlessly fit into existing workflows.    7. Slack    Every organization needs a communication channel. The one I found to be decent based on my experience is Slack. Such tools can change depending on your organization, so you don’t really need to learn a single tool. You can easily get a hang of it in less than 5 minutes.    8. Confluence    Confluence is a collaboration and document management tool developed by Atlassian. It is designed to facilitate teamwork, allowing teams to create, share, and collaborate on content in a centralized and organized manner. Confluence provides a platform for creating, editing and organizing content, including documents, meeting notes, project plans, and more. It is often used for knowledge management, project documentation, and team collaboration.    9. Jira    Jira is a widely used project management and issue-tracking software developed by Atlassian. Originally designed for software development teams, Jira has evolved to be a versatile tool used across various industries for managing projects, tracking issues, and facilitating collaboration among teams. Key features of Jira include issue tracking, project management, reporting and dashboards, and integration with other products.    10. Bash / Makefile    A lot of times you need automation to perform some reducant tasks, or to create aliases for some lengthy commands. Bash scripting and Makefiles will be your companion and it is good to have a beginner's knowledge about them. I use them in almost every project.    10. Rectangle Window Manager    Don’t about rest, but if you are using a Mac, this might be the best free window manager tool out there. Can easily split and arrange multiple windows.    11. Google Calendar    At work, I use it for scheduling meetings and tracking holidays. Really simple and easy to use, can see the whole team's schedule as well.    12. Vim / Nano    Vim and Nano are shell-based text editors. you can open any file, make changes, and save. I personally use Vim. Even though you can do that in a normal text editor or an IDE, sometimes it is helpful to quickly open a file in the terminal, edit, and save it. Being familiar with basic usage can be handy.    13. Grammarly    No matter how good you are at English, Grammarly is always better. Really helpful for writing documentation and guides. I always run it before publishing my final draft.    ",

//       "Hello there! Data structures and algorithms, the foundation of computer science, are not just theoretical but have real-world uses. These fundamental ideas aren’t just theoretical — they’re what make everyday tech work so well. Data structures and algorithms are crucial in solving many practical problems, from websites and social networks to gaming and e-commerce. This article demonstrates the wide-ranging applications of computer science   Applying Data Structures and Algorithms in Web Development   Data structures and algorithms are a big deal in the world of web development. They help make web apps faster and more scalable. By using these key concepts, we can efficiently handle user data, process things smoothly on the server side, and quickly respond to requests. Let’s talk about hash tables. They’re all the rage for fast data retrieval. You can find user info, session data, and other key-value pairs in a jiffy. And that’s super important for giving users a smooth experience. You can totally tell how efficient it is in features like auto-complete search bars or user authentication, where speed and accuracy are key.   Plus, graph algorithms are used to optimize network traffic and resource allocation, so web apps are fast and efficient. These algorithms can make data routing through servers more efficient or handle dependencies between different parts of a web app. These optimizations are really important in big applications, where dealing with complexity and maintaining performance are ongoing challenges.

//       "Text Generation, Image Generation, Image Processing, Generating Summaries Of Entire Novels, etc. there are only a handful of things that AI can’t do yet. AI is now basically everywhere. Need an essay for school homework? Piece of cake. Need help debugging your code? No problem. Need help solving a complicated math problem? AI can assist you with that as well. These things seemed very difficult a few decades ago, now, everyone can obtain these things, even on a smartphone. So what exactly is the reason for this sudden outburst of AI in almost every department   Let us first understand how AI generation works. The proper name of this AI is Generative AI, also called Gen AI. Generative AI is a type of AI that generates new content based on existing content. Generative AI can generate texts, images, videos, audio, and so much more. Generative AI models are trained by feeding them loads of data, and by loads I mean, billions of different types of data. AI models can be trained or fine-tuned to perform some particular types of tasks.   Please note that this is a very high-level explanation of how Gen AI models work. Training and working on AI models is a very deep and complex task, which requires lots of time and resources. And this is mainly the reason why AI is so advanced now.   You see, training AI models requires a lot of processing power. With the increased computing power that we have these days, AI models that can perform various tasks can be trained. More computing power allows more complex and more sophisticated AI models to be made. Also, faster computers help AI models run more efficiently.   A big factor is the availability of a large dataset. The more data you provide to an AI model, the more it learns and the more creative its output is. A larger dataset enables AI models to know more and thus generate better results, learn from more patterns, and make better predictions. Thus, providing a larger dataset to AI models has helped them in becoming more advanced.   Another big reason is the development of better algorithms. Programmers and engineers all over the world have worked a lot in the past few years to develop new algorithms, and better algorithms, to train more advanced and sophisticated AI models. These algorithms are made particularly for various types of AI models. Since these algorithms are more efficient, they help these models to generate better and more accurate results that look very real and authentic.   So, all of these factors have now made AI much more advanced than it was ten years ago. With various tools such as Chat GPT, Google Bard, Bing AI, LaMDA, and more, writing things like blogs and essays has become much easier. AI has become so advanced these days that it has become hard to identify what is real and what is AI-generated, in fact, this very blog that you are reading about AI could be AI-generated! Is it or is it not? ;)",

//       "Bitrise this week will tighten integration with its DevOps platform for building and deploying mobile applications and the application development services provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud  Announced at the AWS re:Invent 2023 conference, the goal is to provide easier access to automated building, testing and release management capabilities provided by AWS as part of an effort to increase overall efficiency.  Bitrise CEO Barnabas Birmacher said those capabilities will streamline workflows for a Bitrise Mobile DevOps platform that has been specifically designed for building and deploying mobile applications that typically need to be updated frequently.  Based on a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform developed by Bitrise that can be deployed in an AWS cloud computing environment, the integrations will make it simpler to build and run mobile applications at scale, noted Birmacher.  The goal is to reduce the total cost of building mobile applications while at the same time improving developer productivity for mobile applications that have to be thoroughly tested before being made accessible via an application store, he added.  It’s not clear how many organizations will prefer to have a dedicated CI/CD platform for building and deploying mobile applications versus using the same CI/CD platform they might already be relying on to build and deploy other applications. Bitrise claims to have more than 6,000 customers, including Reddit, WISE, Equinox and Philips Hue.  As the percentage of mobile applications that make up an organization’s portfolio continues to increase, the pace at which those applications need to be updated lends itself better to a CI/CD platform optimized for those types of applications, said Birmacher.  In fact, a recent survey conducted by Bitrise found 62% of respondents have been adversely impacted by manual processes that slowed the rate at which mobile applications were deployed and updated. The survey also found (44%) of respondents reported their release approval process is mostly or entirely manual, with only 9% having fully automated application releases.  The survey also found that nearly two-thirds of organizations (66%) have deployed applications that can’t be opened in two seconds or less, which is widely considered the accepted level of performance required for mobile applications. In addition, three-quarters of organizations (75%) required more than two days to address bug fixes.  Many mobile apps have become increasingly mission-critical thanks to digital business transformation initiatives. Consequently, the amount of focus on them within most organizations is high; any issues that arise are likely to be noticed at the highest echelons of an organization. That level of attention can easily put pressure on DevOps teams, mainly because the general expectation among end users is that mobile applications will be regularly updated with new functionality. However, if release processes are largely manual, regularly improving the user experience can become problematic.  Each IT organization will need to decide for itself how best to go about building and deploying mobile applications, but the one thing that is certain is adjustments to DevOps workflows will need to be made as a lot more of these applications are continuously built, deployed and updated.

//     description:
//       "Before Docker, when deploying applications, people typically used virtual machines (VMs) or put apps directly on physical servers without using containers   Example: Imagine a team of three developers working together on a project. One uses Windows, another uses Linux, and the last one uses macOS. Because they have different Operating systems, they need to set up their machines differently with various libraries and files to work on the same project. This can cause conflicts and problems, especially in bigger organizations.   Here’s a breakdown of these methods and their problems:   Deploying Directly on Physical Servers:   Problem: Apps were installed and operated directly on physical servers. Each app had its own requirements and settings, making it hard to handle multiple apps with conflicting needs.   Example: Imagine a server with multiple apps, each needing specific software versions. Changing one app’s requirements could affect others, causing conflicts or unexpected issues.’   “The issues that arise when we use GitHub for project deployment and cloning.”   GitHub is great for handling code, letting people work together, and managing projects. But it doesn’t directly tackle problems with deploying applications, making sure everything works the same in different setups, or organizing what programs need to run.   GitHub handles code versions, but it can’t guarantee that applications run the same in different places. Sometimes, developers face issues because things work on their computer but not in other setups.   GitHub takes care of code and some dependencies, but it might not handle all the different needs of various projects or setups.   Getting Started with Docker:-   Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly.   #Docker Image:   A Docker image is a read-only template (No update, make new) that contains everything needed to run an application eg. the code, runtime, libraries, dependencies, and configuration files.   Docker images act as blueprints for making containers.   Example: Let’s consider an image for a Node.js application. This image includes the Node.js runtime, application code, dependencies (defined in package.json), and configurations like environment variables   #Docker Container:   A container is a runnable instance of an image. It’s a lightweight, isolated, and executable environment that runs an application.   A Docker container has everything about a project that includes, code, runtime, system tools, libraries, settings with specific versions, etc.   We can use this container to build run and share code/application.   Example: Using the Node.js image mentioned earlier, you start a container by running the command docker run -d -p 3000:3000 my-node-app. This command starts a container based on the my-node-app image, mapping port 3000 on the host to port 3000 inside the container, allowing access to the Node.js application.   Easy Summary of Docker Image and Container:   Docker images are like recipes — they define how an application should be built and contain all the necessary ingredients. Containers are the instances of those recipes, the actual dishes prepared according to the recipe. Images are static, while containers are dynamic and can be started, stopped, and deleted based on the image’s specifications.   #NOTE: Imagesare the template of the project/application and containerare the running instance of project. You can create multiple containers from a single image.   A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions used to build a Docker image. It’s essentially a recipe or blueprint that specifies the steps needed to create an image that can later be run as a Docker container.   How does Docker work?   Docker works by providing a standard way to run your code. Docker is an operating system for containers.   A Docker container is like a package of software that can be easily moved and run on different servers, whether it’s a laptop, an EC2 instance, or a server in a private data center, as long as those servers can handle containers.   The heart of Docker’s architecture is the Docker daemon.   The Docker daemon is like a helpful middleman between the user and the operating system. It makes managing containers, from creating them to running and cleaning them up, simple and consistent. This ease of use has made containers widely popular.   Regardless of whether Docker is being used on Linux or Windows, you can use the exact same commands to begin working with your application.",

In school, colleges and such, if you major in computer science you must become at least a decent programmer to really benefit from the degree   Preferably you become a really good one. At least to non-computer science individuals. Otherwise there is head knowledge but no application.   Often computer science specialists do not know programming. Though I would still consider them a computer scientist. A programmer is a computer scientist but a computer scientist is not necessarily a programmer.   At least not the good ones…   Computer science is the study of the interrelation of man and machine. This is interfaced with programming or the communication to the machine of what to do.   What kind of scientist which studies machines does not know how to communicate to it?   I know this is kind of a rant but I have met too many individuals who say they love to study computer science but not programming.   Scope of Computer Science Engineering?   The scope of computer science engineering is vast because:   Need for new devices and software: With the advancement of technology, the world is paralyzed without innovative devices coming up. That is the reason why there will be the need for immense manpower who are skilled in the field of computer science.   IT hubs require experts: With every passing date, the number of software companies and IT hubs like Silicon Valley is increasing, and therefore there is an increasing demand for skilled professionals and CSE experts.   Experts required for cloud computing: With the trending concepts like cloud computing, the future technologies are depending on it and most of the companies are looking for a specialist who can hand give the entire segment of cloud computing and help in the progression of the business.   Job in telecommunications: With the Rise in digitalization, telecommunication systems are depending on computer services and that is the reason why computer engineers are employed in this field.   Transportation services: With the resurfacing of the GPS services transportation services are in dire need of computer science engineers.   The manufacturing unit of computers: Needless to say, no one other than the computer science engineers will know how to build computers in the best possible manner. There is a reason why most of the major Fortune 500 computer manufacturing companies are looking forward to hiring more and more efficient computer science engineers.   ",

//     category: 'Recusrion',
//     subCategory: ['function stack', 'coding', 'programming'],
//     description:
//       "For all the time I’ve invested in learning recursion properly in Python, I could have probably started my own small business. No more worrying about landing a fulfilling career in programming and statistics. No more staring at the computer screen for hours-on-end just to figure out a few lines of recursive code. No more searching endless posts on Stack-Overflow while going cross-eyed. In general, no more self-doubt, or fear of wasted time  Programming, at the start, didn’t seem too difficult. Data types, logical operators, and syntax were the order of the day. Then came functions, scope, control structures, try-blocks, comprehensions, and lambdas. However, when I leveled up to data structures that’s when I was first introduced to the ugly python-keyword-green monster called recursion and it was a real challenge.  Pre-requisites for Understanding Recursion  There are two pre-requisites to understand the basics of recursion. The first is understanding what a ‘base case’ is. And the second being, understanding what a ‘stack’ data structure is.  Base Case: A base-case can be simply thought of as a stopping condition for a recursive function.  Keep Your Hands Off My Stack  Stacks, in my honest opinion, are one of the easiest data structures to understand. Think Pez dispenser; think of cafeteria tray holders. You know, the holders where we push the tray into a spring loaded mechanism. These are perfect analogies for how a stack functions. Think of a list whose elements can only enter and leave through one side.  When we add elements to an empty stack, we .push() them on, one by one, stacking them like cafeteria trays or Pez until the stack is full. When removing elements we .pop() them off the top of the stack, one by one.  This operating principle is called ‘First in Last Out’ or F.I.L.O., or depending on which way you think about it, ‘Last In First Out’, L.I.F.O. These two ideas, F.I.L.O. and L.I.F.O., are equivalent. Take the time to familiarize yourself; it is important to have this straight in your head.  The Analogy  Recursion is a programming technique that can be used in place of control structures like for-loops and while-loops. It uses a data structure called a stack to store intermediate results as the function calls itself any number of times and works its way toward a base condition. Once the base condition is met the condition acts like a key that unlocks the solution for each stack layer. This is unlike for-loops, that use iterator objects, and while-loops, which use conditions to propel themselves forward through the code.  Here is an analogy I came up with to describe what recursion is like:  “Recursion is like reading through a complicated Wikipedia article and having to hit any number of links in between before you can fully understand it.”  Let’s focus on this analogy for a moment, because I really do think it captures the essence of what recursion is. It is one of those analogies that came to fruition amidst a prolonged study session. You know, the type of thought that can be interpreted as “a moment of clarity”.  Suppose we are reading a Wikipedia article and come across a link that contains a nested concept. Additionally, we realize that to be able to finish the article we must understand said concept. What do we usually do? We usually pause where we currently are in the article, click the link, and begin reading the second article.  Now suppose, we come across a nested concept in the second article. Sure enough, we realize that we need to understand an additional concept to be able to finish it. What do we usually do? We pause where we currently are in the second article, click the link, and begin reading the third article.  After reading the third article in its entirety, we realize that we understood every concept therein.  This means we can recurse to the second article, start reading from where we left off and finish it, assuming there are no additional concepts to be understood.  Moreover, since we have completed the second article, we can recurse to the first article, start reading from where we left off and, most awesomely, finish the original article in it’s entirety. Of course assuming there are no additional concepts to be understood  Putting It All Together  What exactly is the base case in the above analogy? Or, “what is the stack?”, you may ask. Let’s look closer.  Base Case: being able to finish an article in it’s entirety, and then realizing, that you are able to finish all three articles as a consequence. It is when the recursion stops  Function Call: every time we clicked on a link to navigate to another nested concept the function call was ‘pushed’ onto the stack. We could call the function f(read new concept, so we can complete current article)  Stack: the stack in this case is implicit. It is where the half-completed articles would be held until we reached the base case. Then ‘popped’ off sequentially as were able to finish the articles.",

//     subCategory: ['Coding', 'Programming', 'passion'],
//     description:
//       "First of all, Robert C. Martin’s “Clean Code” is a foundational work in the field of software development that highlights the significance of designing readable, maintainable, and clean code. Martin, a well-known software engineer and author, offers insights into the ideas and procedures that result in high-quality code by drawing on his vast expertise   Clean Code in Chapter 1:   The first section of the book defines clean code and explains its importance. In addition to being syntactically sound, clean code also reduces dependencies and is expressive and simple to read. The chapter emphasizes the idea that code should be written for people, not for machines, and presents the metaphor of code as a tale.   Chapter 2: Meaningful Names:   Martin stresses the significance of giving variables, functions, and classes meaningful names. Code readability may be greatly improved by using descriptive titles, which make it simpler for future you and other readers to comprehend the function and goal of each part.   Chapter 3: Purposes and Features   The design and organization of functions are covered in detail in the third chapter. Martin is a promoter of compact, targeted functions that perform a single task effectively. He presents the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), which exhorts programmers to create functions with a distinct and single goal. The significance of function arguments and return values is also covered in this chapter.   Chapter 4: Comments:   Martin contends that writing clear, concise code is the best approach to make code self-explanatory, despite the fact that many developers use comments as a means of clarification. He is a supporter of reducing the amount of comments used and pushing developers to express themselves directly in the code. If remarks are required, they ought to be made with more emphasis on the “why” than the “how.”   Chapter 5: Formatting:   This chapter focuses on thoughtful and consistent code formatting. Martin presents the notion that a code’s formatting ought to be an essential component of its meaning. Code readability and maintainability are enhanced by consistent spacing, indentation, and organization.   The relationship between objects and data structures is examined in Chapter 6:   Objects and Data Structures. Martin talks about the trade-offs between preserving encapsulation and disclosing an object’s internal workings. He presents the Law of Demeter and exhorts programmers to aim for a harmony between data structure design and object-oriented design.   Chapter 7: Error Handling:   One of the most important components of reliable software is effective error handling. Martin presents the idea of exceptions as a more streamlined version of error codes and explores several error-handling techniques. The chapter also discusses the value of logging and how to gracefully handle errors without endangering the stability of the system.   Chapter 8: Boundaries:   It’s critical to establish distinct boundaries between your code and external components when interacting with external systems, like databases or third-party libraries. Martin offers advice on encapsulating the complexity of external dependencies and designing tidy interfaces.   Chapter 9: Unit Tests:   This chapter examines the fundamentals of creating efficient unit tests, which are a key component of agile development. Martin stresses the significance of creating tests that are quick, independent, and repeatable while introducing the idea of the three laws of TDD (test-driven development).   Chapter 10: Learning Environments   This chapter revisits the idea of classes and objects, emphasizing the need to strike a balance between having a system with few classes and small, focused classes. Martin talks about a number of design concepts, such as the SOLID principles, to help programmers create class structures that are adaptable and easy to maintain.   Systems in Chapter 11:   This chapter goes beyond individual classes to cover building tidy, modular systems. Martin highlights the significance of dependency management while introducing the ideas of components and services. The difficulties of system architecture and the importance of clean code in creating scalable and maintainable systems are also discussed in this chapter.   Chapter12: Emergence:   In this last chapter, the idea of “emergence” in software development is examined. Martin talks about how following clean code guidelines can result in emergent design, which is a situation in which a system’s architecture develops on its own. He makes it clear that consistent focus on code quality leads to good design.   In conclusion, “Clean Code” issues a challenge to developers to pursue excellence in their field. Martin stresses that creating clean code is a continuous process that calls for practice, discipline, and a dedication to lifelong learning rather than a one-time effort. Developers of all skill levels can use the book as a guide to enhance their coding techniques and help produce software that is not only functional but also elegant and manageable.",

I have so much information in here that works when you first start, then works better once you have already started.        This is one of those blog articles you read once when you start writing a research paper.        Then read again after making a bunch of progress.        So I recommend reading this now one time and then again sometime later.        A college degree is not a requirement    At least in the computer science field, you do not need a college degree to publish in academic journals.        Many people seek to publish research papers.        It is a major flex and is often required for specific jobs.        As a professor or professional researcher, your Google Scholar profile, article and citation count are often like your portfolio.        They show you truly are an expert and are at the edge of your field.        In the academic world of professors and college grants publishing computer science research papers is a requirement.        But as a computer science lover, you just require a love for your craft and research.        There are many who publish many papers without entering the academic world and getting no formal degree.        The main advantage you get from going to school and writing research papers in school is the authoritative backing of your professor for difficult publishers and the teaching of how to write a research paper.",

//       "The comparison between brains and computers has been a subject of fascination and debate. While both systems are intricately involved in processing information, they operate on fundamentally different principles   The human brain, with its approximately 86 billion neurons, is an extraordinary biological marvel. It is divided into various regions, each with specific functions. Understanding the intricate structure and organization of the brain is crucial to appreciating its complexity, Neurons, the building blocks of the brain, are specialized cells that transmit information through electrical and chemical signals. Synapses, the junctions between neurons, play a vital role in facilitating communication.   The brain is divided into regions such as the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe, each responsible for different cognitive functions like motor control, sensory perception, memory, and visual processing. The brain excels at parallel processing, allowing it to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. This capability is crucial for activities like walking, talking, and processing sensory information concurrently.   Neuroplasticity, the brain’s ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections, underlies learning and memory. This adaptability is a stark contrast to the fixed architecture of traditional computers. Modern computers, in contrast to the biological complexity of the brain, have a structured and hierarchical architecture. Understanding the key components of computers is essential for grasping their functionalities. The CPU is the brain of the computer, executing instructions and performing calculations. It operates on binary code, representing information as sequences of 0s and 1s.   Computers use various types of memory, including RAM (Random Access Memory) for temporary storage and storage devices like hard drives for long-term data retention. Unlike the parallel processing of the brain, computers primarily rely on serial processing, executing one instruction at a time. This fundamental difference affects their efficiency in handling certain types of tasks. Computer architecture is fixed and predetermined. While advancements like machine learning and neural networks introduce elements of adaptability, computers lack the inherent flexibility and dynamic",

//     description:
//       "Have you ever stumbled upon a Python feature and thought, “I wish I knew this earlier!”? You’re not alone! In this blog, I’am share 20 Python concepts that would’ve made my coding journey smoother. Dive in, and maybe you’ll discover a few gems you’ve missed   1. List Comprehensions   Importance:   List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists, which is beneficial for both readability and, in many cases, performance. It reduces the need for multi-line loops.   When to Use:   Use list comprehensions when you want to transform or filter data, particularly when the logic is simple. They’re suitable for small operations on data sets.   Potential Pitfalls:   Avoid using nested list comprehensions as they can reduce readability. Moreover, if the logic becomes complex, it’s better to use a for loop.   2. Lambda Functions   Importance:   Lambda functions are useful for writing small, throwaway functions without the need for a formal function definition.   When to Use:   They’re particularly handy when you need a simple function for a short period, and you won’t reuse it. Commonly used with `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.   Potential Pitfalls:   Lambda functions can reduce readability when overused or when the logic becomes complex. In such cases, it’s better to define a proper function.   3. Map, Filter, and Reduce   Importance:   These functions offer a functional approach to processing collections. They reduce the need for explicit loops, resulting in cleaner code.   When to Use:   - `map()`: When you want to apply a function to every item of a collection.   - `filter()`: When you need to select items based on a predicate.   - `reduce()`: When you want to cumulatively apply a function to items, reducing the sequence to a single value.   4. Decorators   Importance:   Decorators allow you to extend and modify the behavior of callable objects like functions and methods without permanently modifying the callable itself.   When to Use:   When you want to add functionalities to existing code or when you want to modify the behavior of a function without changing its source code.   5. Generators   Importance:   Generators provide a way to iterate over large datasets without loading everything into memory. They produce items on-the-fly and can be more memory-efficient.   When to Use:   For large datasets, streams, or when you need to represent infinite sequences.   6. f-Strings   Importance:   Introduced in Python 3.6, f-strings provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals.   When to Use:   Whenever you want to embed variable values inside strings or when formatting strings.   7. *args and **kwargs   Importance:   Allows you to pass a variable number of arguments to a function, offering flexibility.   When to Use:   When you’re not sure about the number of arguments, or when designing functions/methods for a broad range of use cases.   8. Type Hinting   Importance:   Introduced in Python 3.5, type hinting helps in making the code more readable and allows for better IDE support and static type checking.   When to Use:   For enhancing code clarity, especially in larger projects or libraries meant for public consumption.   9. Context Managers (with statement)   Importance:   Context managers ensure resources are efficiently managed and properly closed after usage, making code cleaner and resource management more foolproof.   When to Use:   When working with resources like files, databases, or network connections that require proper setup and teardown.   10. Walrus Operator (:=)   Importance:   Introduced in Python 3.8, the walrus operator helps assign values to variables as part of an expression.   When to Use:   Useful when you need both a value from an expression and want to retain that value for later use.   ",

//       "What is Quantum Computing?   A combination of computer science, physics, and mathematics, quantum computing leverages quantum mechanics to solve complicated problems more quickly than traditional computers.   Application development and hardware research are included in the topic of quantum computing.   Quantum computers leverage quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition and quantum interference to tackle some kinds of problems more quickly than conventional computers.   Optimization, modeling of physical systems, and machine learning (ML) are a few areas where quantum computers can offer such a performance improvement.   Potential applications include chemical system simulation and portfolio optimization in finance, which would involve tackling issues that are presently insurmountable for even the most potent supercomputers available.   What is Qubit?   Quantum particles serve as the representation for quantum bits, or qubits. The processing power of a quantum computer is mostly derived from the manipulation of qubits by control devices.   Bits in classical computers are comparable to qubits in quantum computing. The processor of a classical machine essentially manipulates bits to do all of its tasks. Comparably, the quantum processor processes qubits to accomplish all of its tasks.   What are the principles of quantum computing?   Superposition   According to superposition, you may combine two or more quantum states to create a new, legitimate quantum state, just as waves in conventional physics.   On the other hand, each quantum state may alternatively be expressed as the product of two or more separate states. Quantum computers are inherently parallel due to the superposition of qubits, which enables them to conduct millions of operations at once.   Entanglement   When two systems are so intimately linked that understanding one instantly provides understanding of the other, regardless of their distance from one another, this phenomenon is known as quantum entanglement.   Measurements of one particle can be used by quantum computers to infer information about another. It may be ascertained, for instance, that when one qubit spins upward, the other will invariably spin downward, and vice versa. Quantum computers can tackle complicated problems more quickly thanks to quantum entanglement.   Decoherence   The loss of a qubit’s quantum state is known as decoherence. Radiation and other environmental conditions have the potential to collapse the qubits’ quantum states. Designing the numerous elements that try to postpone the state’s decoherence, such creating specialized structures that protect the qubits from outside influences, is a significant technical difficulty in the construction of a quantum computer.   Future potential quantum computing uses   Cybersecurity   Privacy and encryption may be directly impacted by quantum computing.   Quantum computers may be able to maintain data encryption while it is being used, offering both in-transit and at-rest security, given how quickly the cybersecurity landscape is changing.   Batteries   Manufacturers may find it easier to incorporate novel materials into semiconductors and batteries if they use quantum computing.   This might provide additional light on how to maximize the lifespan and efficiency of batteries.   Additionally, manufacturers can benefit from a greater understanding of lithium compounds and battery chemistry thanks to quantum computing. For instance, quantum computing may be able to access and comprehend the functioning of protein docking energy, leading to improved electric vehicle batteries.   Manufacturing   Testing and prototyping can be carried out with greater accuracy and realism thanks to quantum computing. This could lead to better designs that require less testing in the manufacturing sector and lower the cost of prototyping.   AI and machine learning (ML)   AI and ML stand to gain greatly from the capacity to calculate solutions to problems simultaneously rather than sequentially. Businesses now use AI and ML to find ways to optimize and automate processes. Optimization can occur much more quickly and at scale when combined with quantum computing, particularly when processing and analyzing extremely complex or even unstructured large data sets.   Conclusion:   Quantum computing holds great promise for solving some of the world’s most pressing issues more quickly, accurately, efficiently, and on a larger scale. The true question, as we strive to improve and scale our current quantum capabilities, is when we will reach that future.   ",

//     category: 'OpenSource',
//     subCategory: ['skill', 'GitHub', 'GitBash'],
//     description:
//       "Open-source communities, just like physical products or software applications, can be viewed and managed with a product-oriented approach. In fact, product management principles and strategies can better serve both the communities that support open-source software (OSS) projects and the businesses that depend on them   Let’s get one thing clear before we start: OSS communities are made up of humans—generally passionate, devoted humans at that—and should never be thought of as commodities. Rather, because they aren’t commodities, I argue that OSS community management deserves the same intentionality your organization shows to product management. A business wouldn’t take its product development for granted, so why would you neglect the OSS community that’s fundamental to the project’s very existence?   The world runs on open source technology, but open source communities notoriously face challenges ranging from resource constraints, governance issues, and a dependence on volunteerism, which itself is dependent upon individual passions and constrained time commitments. Executing open source technology well takes strategy—and a different mindset. To be effective, we need to think of it more like a product—dare I say, business—if we hope to achieve an open-source community’s goals..   My career has spanned both product management and engineering, often in an entrepreneurial setting where everyone is building something from nothing. Throughout it all, open source has been at the center. The products that my colleagues and I created wouldn't exist without the extensive use of open source software. Now at Sauce Labs (whose founders are also the Selenium creators), open source is even more relevant to the work I do every day.   If there’s one thing I’ve learned on my journey, it’s that open-source projects and the companies that depend on them fail to grow if they lack good product management principles and don’t balance business interests with community stakeholders. We don't require additional contributors, features, or bug reports; instead, what we need is alignment in processes and procedures. This means we need strong and streamlined product management practices and the right product market fit in place in order to accommodate the duality of success in both practices.   Viewing a community as a product in the context of software development means treating the community surrounding a product, such as users, contributors, and supporters, as if it were a product itself (again, not a commodity!). This perspective focuses on intentionally developing a community so that it satisfies customer needs.. The journey starts by understanding product-market fit.   What is product market fit?   While specific definitions of ”product market fit” (PMF) vary, the concept is the degree to which a product satisfies the needs and preferences of a target market. Product managers know this well; we spend countless hours reading stories from companies that have reached this milestone and, unfortunately, even more headlines about those that do not. Let’s break this definition down:   The market   In an open-source context, the market is the community of people who use the code and care enough about your project to contribute additional code, ideas, feature requests, testing, translations, bugs, security audits, blog posts, and more. It can be quite tricky to figure out, but available market research should be used at all times.   For example, developer surveys from GitLab, Stack Overflow, and others provide great insight into the different types of developer groups and their needs. Similar to a product, you need to continually re-evaluate the market you operate in to understand if that market is changing or evolving.   The community is incredibly important because these are the people who will contribute to the project in some way (at least a small subset will). We look at community as a way to give back and give forward. What we mean by this is contributions from the user community play an indispensable role in the success of open source projects, allowing them to continuously evolve, remain relevant, and serve a wider audience. It fosters collaboration, innovation, and community-driven development. Serving the open source community and building upon it means that contributions will be user-centric, offer value, implement feedback and iteration, maximize growth strategies, and monetize on long-term sustainability. In many ways, this is a symbiotic journey; an OSS community can make a business’ PMF more precise, and the business can make the OSS community stronger because of it.   Sometimes the users of the project are very different from those with the expertise or desire to contribute back, meaning the users of the software may have different backgrounds, skills, or motivations compared to those who actively participate in the development of the software. This is a sticky situation to be in because you might be forced to go down the path of finding “mercenary programmers” to keep the project in motion. This is another area to keep top of mind and re-evaluate continuously; if the user community is not naturally contributing to the project, project leaders need to regularly evaluate the options and strategies for keeping the project alive and progressing. It's important to consider whether paid developers or alternative means of support are necessary to sustain the project over time.   The product   The “product” is essentially the solution you have created to solve a problem for a group of users in your market. My favorite approach (and the approach of the best product companies) to finding the right product is to think about it based on four key risk factors:   Value - Will customers find enough value in my solution to choose it?   Usable - How easy is it to use my product?   Viable - Can I afford to build the product?   Feasible - Do I possess the skills and technology to build it?   Here's how you can implement the key concepts that successful product companies use in your open-source project; Cal.com is a great example of an open source project that builds with a PMF focused approach. Ask yourself these questions, and you’ll discover the answers you need to move forward. Don’t worry, you don’t have to be a product manager with decades of experience to get this right:   Value   What is your ideal customer profile and persona?   Who is the decision maker (it might not be the developer)?   What problem do you solve?   Who is the competition? How do you differentiate yourself?   Usable   How easy is it to onboard? What is the time-to-value for your project?   What friction points exist in the workflow of your product? Do you know?   How do you get feedback from users?   Viable   At a product company, you are only viable if you can afford to pay people to build your product. The equivalent is building a community in OSS.   How do you plan to build the community? Is what you are building interesting enough to build a community around? Will your personas find it interesting to contribute to?   Are you planning on building your community from the employees of a company?   This is where a business model becomes essential, and many companies choose between models such as the Red Hat model or open source managed services.   Feasible   Related to the community, do the skills of your target persona match those who need to contribute to your tool?   For example, we've observed instances of GenAI projects that don't align properly, where the tool is created by data scientists but for developers.   Open-source technology is changing rapidly due to the collaborative nature of these projects, increased financial support, market demand, and the ability to adapt quickly to emerging technologies and changing circumstances. Amid all these changes (or perhaps because of them), open-source project maintenance rates are in steep decline, and the future of open source is at a crossroads.   We need to underscore the idea that successful open-source communities require planning, organization, attention to user needs, and ongoing improvement, similar to the way a product is developed and refined. Open source plays a central role in business, but businesses are taking actions that are reshaping the dynamics of this relationship. Due to various conflicting interests and project licensing intrigue (way too much to get into here), an “Us vs. Them” mentality pervades the discourse around open source.   Successful open source projects and thriving open-core businesses are not mutually exclusive. In fact, many of the most successful OSS projects depend on corporate sponsorship. Out of context, it might sound callous to adopt a product manager's mindset to an open-source project made up of the collective efforts of passionate humans.   But it’s my belief that maintainers who align the interests of both community and business are the ones who build many of the most sustainable, enduring projects. You're not a sellout, you’re a buy-in.",

As the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve, protecting intellectual property through patents has become increasingly important. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of obtaining a blockchain patent, from understanding the basics to navigating the complexities of patent law    Bybit offer: Deposit $50, and GET 10 USDT (withdrawable)!    Understanding Blockchain Technology    Before delving into the intricacies of obtaining a blockchain patent, it’s crucial to grasp the fundamentals of blockchain technology. At its core, a blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. It relies on cryptographic techniques to secure and verify these transactions, ensuring transparency, immutability, and decentralization. Blockchain technology is not limited to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin; it has a wide range of applications in various sectors, including finance, supply chain management, healthcare, and more. These applications are often the foundation for innovative inventions eligible for patent protection.    Also read: Best Blockchain Certification Courses To Boost Your Career    What is a Patent?    A patent is a legal document granted by a government authority that gives the patent holder exclusive rights to their invention for a specified period, usually 20 years from the filing date. In the context of blockchain technology, obtaining a patent can safeguard your innovative ideas, prevent others from using, making, or selling your invention without your permission, and provide a competitive advantage in the market.    Types of Blockchain Patents    Blockchain patents typically fall into three categories:    A. Utility Patents: These cover new and useful processes, machines, or compositions of matter related to blockchain technology. Utility patents are the most common type of patent for blockchain inventions.    b. Design Patents: These protect the ornamental design or visual appearance of a blockchain-related product. While less common in the blockchain space, design patents may apply to hardware wallets, interfaces, or other visually distinctive aspects of blockchain technology.    C. Plant Patents: These are unrelated to blockchain technology and pertain to new and distinct plant varieties.    4. Patent Eligibility    To obtain a blockchain patent, your invention must meet specific criteria:    A. Novelty: Your invention must be new and not publicly disclosed or available before the patent filing date.    B. Non-obviousness: The invention should not be an obvious improvement or variation of existing technology to someone skilled in the field    C. Utility: The invention must have a practical, real-world use or application.    D. Enablement: Your patent application must provide enough information to enable someone skilled in the field to recreate and use the invention.    E. Subject Matter Eligibility: In the United States, the subject matter must be eligible for patent protection. While laws may change, software and abstract ideas alone are typically not eligible, but specific applications of blockchain technology can be.    Conducting a Prior Art Search    Before proceeding with your patent application, it’s essential to conduct a thorough prior art search. This involves looking for existing patents, publications, and other public disclosures that may be similar to your invention. A comprehensive search helps identify potential obstacles and ensures that your invention is novel and non-obvious.    Drafting a Patent Application    Drafting a patent application is a critical step in the process. It requires clear and concise documentation of your invention, including detailed descriptions, drawings, and claims. Patent claims define the scope of your invention and are essential for determining infringement. It’s advisable to seek legal counsel from a patent attorney or agent experienced in blockchain technology to help draft a robust patent application. They can ensure that your application complies with the specific requirements of patent law and maximizes your chances of success.    Filing the Patent Application    Once your patent application is ready, you’ll need to file it with the relevant government authority, such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in the United States. The application will undergo a thorough examination process, which can take several years. During this period, you may need to respond to examination requests, clarifications, or objections from patent examiners. An experienced patent attorney can assist you in navigating this process.    International Considerations    If your blockchain invention has global applicability, you may consider filing for international patents. The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) allows you to file a single international application, which can later be converted into individual patents in various countries. International patent protection can be crucial for safeguarding your invention in multiple markets.    Costs and Fees    Obtaining a blockchain patent involves various costs, including application fees, attorney fees, and maintenance fees to keep the patent in force. It’s essential to budget for these expenses and plan for the ongoing financial commitments associated with patent maintenance.    Patent Enforcement    Once your blockchain patent is granted, you have the exclusive right to enforce it against infringing parties. This means you can take legal action against individuals or organizations that use, make, or sell your patented invention without permission. Enforcement often involves litigation, which can be a complex and costly process. Therefore, it’s crucial to have a strategy in place for protecting your intellectual property rights.    Defending Against Patent Challenges    While having a blockchain patent provides protection, it may also attract challenges from competitors or parties who believe your patent is invalid. Defending your patent rights may involve legal proceedings, so it’s essential to be prepared for potential disputes.    Patent Strategy    Developing a comprehensive patent strategy is crucial for maximizing the value of your blockchain patents. This strategy should align with your business goals and consider factors such as licensing opportunities, partnerships, and potential competitors. A well-thought-out patent strategy can help you leverage your intellectual property for competitive advantage.    Conclusion    Blockchain technology’s pervasive impact across industries underscores the importance of securing intellectual property through patents. Understanding the nuances of blockchain patents, including their types and eligibility criteria, is vital. Conducting a thorough prior art search, drafting a robust patent application with professional guidance, and navigating the examination process are essential steps. International considerations, costs, and enforcement strategies should also be part of your patent journey. In a rapidly evolving landscape, a well-crafted patent strategy is indispensable, empowering innovators to protect their blockchain inventions and leverage them effectively in the competitive market.",

//       "Cryptography is the process of converting ordinary plaintext into incomprehensible text, also known as ciphertext. Then the data can be stored or transmitted in a particular form, and only those for whom it is intended can read and process it. Cryptography protects data from theft or alteration while also being useful for user authentication    Modern cryptography exists through the combination of advanced security processes that use complex encryption methods to encode messages so only authorized parties can see them. The plaintext is converted into ciphertext using an encryption algorithm that generates an encryption key. Then the recipient must use a decryption key to turn the ciphertext back into plaintext.    Types of Cryptography    1. Symmetric Encryption    This method uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. After the sender encrypts the plaintext using this key, it sends the ciphertext to the receiver. Then the receiver applies the same key to decrypt the ciphertext and recover the plaintext.    Examples: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard), and IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm).    Also it is generally categorized as being either Stream Cipher or Block Cipher. However, one of the risks of symmetric key encryption is that, if the shared private key is compromised, the whole system for securing data becomes compromised.    Stream cipher — a symmetric cryptographic technique where it converts plaintext into ciphertext by taking byte by byte of plaintext. ChaCha and RC4 are the most widely used stream cipher alogorithms.    Block cipher — a symmetric cryptographic technique that converts plaintext into ciphertext as fixed-size blocks. Usually, plaintext’s size exceeds a block’s size. Therefore, plaintext is broken up into a number of sequential blocks, and the cipher operates on these blocks one at a time.    Block ciphers are more complex, versatile, and robust than stream ciphers, as they can support different modes of operation and paddings. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard) are examples of Block cipher alogorithms.    2. Asymmetric Encryption    Asymmetric cryptography helps eliminate the key sharing problem by generating two different keys — a private key and a public key. This is known as public-key encryption and uses a public key to encrypt the plaintext, while the private key decrypts the ciphertext.    As an example, let’s think of the public key as the key to our mailbox. It opens the mailbox only to drop letters. We can share this key with anyone who sends us letters. So they can drop the letters into our mailbox and only we have the private key, which we use to get the letters out.    Examples: RSA (Rivest Shamir Adleman) considered one of the most secure asymmetric key encryption algorithms.    3. Hash Functions    This method uses a one-way encryption algorithm to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext. Values returned by a hash function are called message digests or hash values. It’s impossible to revert a hash value to plaintext, and no two plaintexts will yield the same hash for a given hash function.    Examples: SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512    Key Types    Secret key — a single key which is used in symmetric encryption to encrypt and decrypt a message.    Public key — The public component of the cryptographic keys used for encryption in asymmetric cryptography.    Private key — the secret component of the cryptographic keys used for decryption in asymmetric cryptography.    Encryption Mode and Padding    Modes — describes how the different blocks of a multi-block plaintext should be encrypted and decrypted. There are 5 modes of operation, such as Electronic CodeBook (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Cipher feedback (CFB), Output Feedback (OFB), Counter Mode (CTR).    Padding — some modes (such as ECB and CBC) require that the final block to be padded before encryption.    Android cryptography    This process based on the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA), which separates the interfaces and implementation. It’s possible to include several security providers that can implement sets of cryptographic algorithms. Most of the JCA interfaces and classes are defined in Java.security.    This document describes how to perform symmetric key encryption using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm    Transformation    Algorithm — AES(Advanced Encryption Standard)    Modes — CBC(Cipher Block Chaining)    Paddings — PKCS7Padding    Note: In CBC mode, it uses an initialization vector (IV) to prevent having the same plaintext result in the same ciphertext.

//       "On a recent trip to my hometown in Eastern Canada, my father picked me up at the airport. One of the first things he asked me was, “Is AI going to take everyone’s jobs?”    When AI, generative AI, and large language models (LLM) have become topics of conversation within the senior citizen community of rural Canada, you know it’s on everyone’s minds. Generative AI, and especially the use of LLMs, is the “new new thing”. It dominates my X (i.e. Twitter) feed and nearly every conversation I have about technology.    There’s justifiably a ton of excitement about the power of generative AI, reminiscent of the introduction of the Internet or the first smartphone. Generative AI is poised to transform how we build products, design drugs, write content, and interact with technology. But as the utilization of AI grows, many governments and companies have raised concerns about the privacy and compliance issues that adopters of these technologies face.    The core challenge posed by generative AI right now is that unlike conventional applications, LLMs have no “delete” button. There’s no straightforward mechanism to “unlearn” specific information, no equivalent to deleting a row in your database’s user table. In a world where the “right to be forgotten” is central to many privacy regulations, using LLMs presents some difficult challenges.    So what does all this mean for businesses that are building new AI-powered applications or AI models?    In this post, we’ll explore this question and attempt to provide answers. We’ll examine the potential impact of generative AI, ongoing compliance hurdles, and a variety of privacy strategies. Finally, we’ll examine a novel approach grounded in the IEEE's recommended architecture for securely storing, managing, and utilizing sensitive customer PII (Personally Identifiable Information)—the data privacy vault.    Generative AI’s privacy and compliance challenges    Imagine the following scenario: You've just copied and pasted sensitive contract details into an LLM to get some quick assistance with routine contract due diligence. The LLM serves its purpose, but here's the catch: depending on how it's configured, that confidential contract data might linger within the LLM, accessible to other users. Deleting it isn't an option, predicting its future use—or misuse—becomes a daunting task, and retraining the LLM to “roll it back” to its state before you shared those sensitive contract details can be prohibitively expensive.    The only foolproof solution?    Keep sensitive data far away from LLMs.    Sensitive information, including internal company project names, core intellectual property, or personal data like birthdates, social security numbers, and healthcare records, can inadvertently find its way into LLMs in several ways:    Training data: LLMs are trained and honed on expansive datasets that often contain PII. Without robust anonymization or redaction measures in place, sensitive data becomes part of the model's training dataset, meaning that this data can potentially resurface later.    Inference: LLMs generate text based on user inputs or prompts. Much like training data, a prompt containing sensitive data seeps into the model and can influence the generated content, potentially exposing this data.    Privacy laws    AI data privacy is a formidable challenge for any company interested in investing in generative AI technology. Recent temporary bans of ChatGPT in Italy and by companies like Samsung have pushed these concerns to the forefront for businesses looking to invest in generative AI.    Even outside of generative AI, there are increasing concerns about protecting data privacy. Meta was recently fined $1.3 billion by the European Union (EU) for its non-compliant transfers of sensitive data to the U.S. And this isn’t just an issue for companies doing business in the EU.    There are now more than 100 countries with some form of privacy regulation in place. Each country’s privacy regulations include unique and nuanced requirements that place a variety of restrictions on the use and handling of sensitive data. The most common restrictions relate to cross-border data transfers, where sensitive data can be stored, and to individual data subject rights such as the “right to be forgotten.”    One of the biggest shortcomings of LLMs is their inability to selectively delete or unlearn specific data points, such as an individual's name or date of birth. This limitation presents significant risks for businesses leveraging these systems.    For example, privacy regulations in Europe, Argentina, and the Philippines (just to name a few) all support an individual’s “right to be forgotten.” This grants individuals the right to have their personal information removed or erased from a system. Without an LLM delete button, there’s no way for a business to address such a request without retraining their LLM from scratch.    Consider the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which grants individuals the right to access, rectify, and erase their personal data—a task that becomes daunting if that data is embedded within an LLM. GDPR also empowers individuals with the right to object to automated decision-making, further complicating compliance for companies that use LLMs.    Data localization requirements pose another challenge for users of LLMs. These requirements pertain to the physical location where customer data is stored. Different countries and regions have precise laws dictating how customer data should be handled, processed, stored, and safeguarded. This poses a significant challenge when using an LLM used for a company’s global customer base.    Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs) under GDPR and other laws add another layer of complexity. In the EU and California, individuals (i.e., “data subjects”) have the right to request access to their personal data, but complying with such requests proves challenging if that data has been processed by LLMs.    Considering the intricate privacy and compliance landscape and the complexity of LLMs, the most practical approach to maintaining compliance is to prevent sensitive data from entering the model altogether. By implementing stringent data handling practices, businesses can mitigate the privacy risks associated with LLMs, while also maintaining the utility of the model. Many companies have already decided that the risks are too high, so they’ve banned the use of ChatGPT, but this approach is shortsighted. Properly managed, these models can create a lot of value.    Privacy approaches for generative AI    To address the privacy challenges associated with generative AI models, there have been a few proposals such as banning or controlling access, using synthetic data instead of real data, and running private LLMs.    Banning ChatGPT and other generative AI systems isn’t an effective long-term strategy, and these other “band aid” approaches are bound to fail as people can find easy workarounds. Using synthetic data replaces sensitive information with similar-looking but non-sensitive data and keeps PII out of the model, but at the cost of losing the value that motivated you to share sensitive data with the LLM in the first place. The model loses context, and there’s no referential integrity between the synthetically generated data and the original sensitive information.    The most popular approach to addressing AI data privacy, and the one that’s being promoted by cloud providers like Google, Microsoft, AWS, and Snowflake, is to run your LLM privately on their infrastructure.    For example, with Snowflake’s Snowpark Model Registry, you can take an open source LLM and run it within a container service in your Snowflake account. They state that this allows you to train the LLM using your proprietary data.    However, there are several drawbacks to using this approach.    Outside of privacy concerns, if you’re choosing to run an LLM privately rather than take advantage of an existing managed service, then you’re stuck with managing the updates, and possibly the infrastructure, yourself. It’s also going to be much more expensive to run an LLM privately. Taken together, these drawbacks mean running a private LLM likely doesn’t make sense for most companies.    But the bigger issue is that, from a privacy standpoint, private LLMs simply don’t provide effective data privacy. Private LLMs give you model isolation, but they don’t provide data governance in the form of fine-grained access controls: any user who can access the private LLM can access all of the data that it contains. Data privacy is about giving a user control over their data, but private LLMs still suffer from all of the intrinsic limitations around data deletion that are blocking the adoption of public LLMs.    What matters to a business—and individual data subjects—is who sees what, when, where, and for how long. Using a private LLM doesn’t give you the ability to make sure that Susie in accounting sees one type of LLM response based on her job title while Bob in customer support sees something else.    So how can we prevent PII and other sensitive data from entering an LLM, but also support data governance so we can control who can see what and support the need to delete sensitive data?    A new approach to PII management    In the world of traditional data management, an increasingly popular approach to protecting the privacy of sensitive data is through the use of a data privacy vault. A data privacy vault isolates, protects, and governs sensitive customer data while facilitating region-specific compliance with laws like GDPR through data localization.    With a vault architecture, sensitive data is stored in your vault, isolated outside of your existing systems. Isolation helps ensure the integrity and security of sensitive data, and simplifies the regionalization of this data.",

//       "Welcome back to our thrilling journey through the history of AI! In the first part of this series, we ventured into the inception of AI, where ideas blossomed like spring flowers. Now, we’re diving even deeper, right into the heart of the action at the historic Dartmouth Workshop of 1956.       The Confluence of Minds at Dartmouth       Imagine a room buzzing with the intellect of visionaries — these weren’t just ordinary folks; they were the rock stars of AI pioneers.  John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon, to name a few, graced the Dartmouth Workshop with their presence. These weren’t just thinkers; they were doers, poised to shape the future.       Nathaniel Rochester declared, “We had a whiteboard and bold ideas. Failure was not an option.”        Coining “Artificial Intelligence”       Hold onto your hats, because this is the moment where “artificial intelligence” was birthed. Imagine John McCarthy, the maestro of the workshop, coining this iconic phrase.  It wasn’t just about naming a field; it was about crystallizing a vision. McCarthy’s genius echoed through the decades, shaping our understanding of AI.       John McCarthy himself said, “We needed a name for this new field, something that captures the essence of creating intelligent machines.”        Ambitious Goals and Bold Aspirations       Now, picture this: a room filled with passionate thinkers setting goals that would change the course of technology.  Machine learning, problem-solving, language understanding — these audacious aspirations became the North Star of AI research. They didn’t just dream; they dared to make those dreams a reality.       Marvin Minsky exclaimed, “We thought we could simulate intelligence and, in doing so, change the world.”        **The Early Challenges of AI**       But it wasn’t all smooth sailing. The early pioneers faced a host of challenges. Can you fathom AI with the computing power of the 1950s?  They grappled with technological limitations, and many skeptics questioned the very possibility of AI. Yet, they pressed on, fueled by unbridled curiosity.       Claude Shannon, with a touch of humor, noted, “We were building the future on the shoulders of vacuum tubes and punch cards.”        The Legacy of Dartmouth Workshop       As we unravel the history, we can’t ignore the long-lasting impact of the Dartmouth Workshop.  It was more than a gathering; it was a transformative event that birthed a relentless curiosity. The goals they set weren’t just for that time; they’ve echoed through the ages, guiding the course of AI research to this day.       John McCarthy had the foresight to say, “The Dartmouth Workshop was just the beginning. The AI journey is an everlasting quest for knowledge.”        Unearthed Gems and Little-Known Facts       Before we wrap up this exciting leg of our journey, here’s a tidbit to savor. Did you know that early AI pioneers often found themselves redrawing the boundaries of their field?  It was a time of discovery and experimentation, where every step forward was a leap into the unknown.   Herbert A. Simon wisely observed, “We didn’t know where AI’s boundaries lay; we were redrawing them as we went along.”       Now, as we leave you hanging on the precipice of AI’s incredible history, anticipate the final part of our series, where we’ll bring it all together.  We’ll explore the legacy of AI’s early days and glimpse into the future. So, keep that curiosity burning, because the best is yet to come!",
